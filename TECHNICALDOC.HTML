            JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time
            compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it
            is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
            non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache
            CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based,
            multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting
            object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional
            programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.

          <p>There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:</p>
          <code>
            <ul>
              <li>Var</li>
              <li>Let</li>
              <li>Constant</li>

          <p>
            Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript.
            A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of
            statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a
            procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and
            return an output where there is some obvious relationship between
            the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it
            somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

        <header>Data types</header>
        <article>
          <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines eight data types:</p>
          <code>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Seven data types that are primitives:
                <ol>
                  <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                  <li>
                    null. A special keyword denoting a null value. (Because
                    JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                    NULL, or any other variant.)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: 42
                    or 3.14159.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    BigInt. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example:
                    9007199254740992n.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    String. A sequence of characters that represent a text
                    value. For example: "Howdy"
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                    are unique and immutable.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Object</li>
            </ul>
          </code>
          <p>
            Although these data types are relatively few, they enable you to
            perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
            functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You
            can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions
            as procedures that your script can perform.

        <article>
          <p>
            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
            global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
            current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
            is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
            function. JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block
            statement scope. Rather, a variable declared within a block is local
            to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within.

        <article>
          <p>
            You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
            <br />
            <code>
              The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as any variable
              identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar
              sign ($), and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore
              characters.

      <section class="main-section" id="Operators">
        <header>Operators</header>
        <article>
          <p>JavaScript has the following types of operators:</p>
          <code>
            <ul>
              <li>Assignment operators</li>
              <li>Comparison operators</li>
              <li>Arithmetic operators</li>
              <li>Bitwise operators</li>
              <li>Logical operators</li>
              <li>String operators</li>
              <li>Conditional (ternary) operator</li>
              <li>Comma operator</li>
              <li>Unary operators</li>
              <li>Relational operators</li>
            </ul>
          </code>

          <p>
            JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special
            ternary operator, the conditional operator.
